A group of people with assorted eye colors live on an island. They are all
perfect logicians - if a conclusion can be logically deduced, they will do
it instantly. No one knows the color of their eyes. Every night at midnight,
a ferry stops at the island. Any islanders who have figured out the color of
their own eyes then leave the island, and the rest stay. Everyone can see
everyone else at all times and keeps a count of the number of people they
see with each eye color (excluding themselves), but they cannot otherwise
communicate. Everyone on the island knows all the rules in this paragraph.

On this island there are 100 blue-eyed people, 100 brown-eyed people, and the
Guru (she happens to have green eyes). So any given blue-eyed person can see
100 people with brown eyes and 99 people with blue eyes (and one with green),
but that does not tell him his own eye color; as far as he knows the totals
could be 101 brown and 99 blue. Or 100 brown, 99 blue, and he could have red
eyes.

The Guru is allowed to speak once (let's say at noon), on one day in all their
endless years on the island. Standing before the islanders, she says the
following:

"*I can see someone who has blue eyes.*"

Who leaves the island, and on what night?

**Remarks**:
* There are no mirrors or reflecting surfaces, nothing dumb. It is not a trick
question, and the answer is logical. It doesn't depend on tricky wording or
anyone lying or guessing, and it doesn't involve people doing something silly
like creating a sign language or doing genetics. The Guru is not making eye
contact with anyone in particular; she's simply saying "I count at least one
blue-eyed person on this island who isn't me."
* The answer is *not* "no one leaves."
